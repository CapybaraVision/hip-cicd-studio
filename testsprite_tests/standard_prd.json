    "Responsive design optimized for mobile and ultra-wide screens, with fluid layouts and max-width constraints.",
    "Interactive components with client-side filters on search inputs and simulated real-time status updates.",
    "Persistence of Kanban board drag-and-drop state either locally or via backend integration.",
    "Polished visual effects such as glassmorphism with attention to performance on lower-end devices.",
    "Consistent language usage with centralized string management for localization and interface standardization."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User logs in and lands on the Dashboard home page with high-level KPIs and charts displayed.",
    "User navigates via the Sidebar to the Projects page to view and manage projects.",
    "Within Projects, user interacts with the Kanban board to update task statuses with drag-and-drop, and sees timeline visualizations.",
    "User searches and filters projects with functional search inputs reflecting live results.",
    "User visits the CI/CD page to inspect pipeline stages and track running/pending steps with real-time simulation.",
    "Throughout navigation, the Sidebar updates active state correctly to indicate current page.",
    "User experiences a consistent UI in both light and dark themes, with smooth transitions and performance."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All pages are responsive, with no UI overflow or content obstruction on mobile and ultra-wide monitors.",
    "Dark mode styling follows strict color guidelines, especially for new components on Projects and CI/CD pages.",
    "Drag-and-drop Kanban board state persists after page refresh through local storage or backend persistence.",
    "Sidebar highlights correctly reflect the current route using accurate `usePathname` logic.",
    "Search filters on Projects and Pipeline pages function correctly with client-side filtering.",
    "Chart tooltips are fully visible and not clipped by parent containers, confirming proper z-index layering.",
    "Real-time pipeline simulation visibly updates status progress dynamically using React hooks.",
    "Hydration warnings are resolved with proper handling of SSR and client-only logic such as theme or localStorage access.",
    "All user-facing text is consistent in language and managed centrally to avoid mixed language issues.",
    "No unused imports remain and the codebase passes performance audits, ensuring bundle size optimization for Recharts and Framer Motion."
